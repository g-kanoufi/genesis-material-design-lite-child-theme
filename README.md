Genesis Material Design Lite Child Theme
===

This child theme is made for Genesis and uses components and style elements/directives from Material design lite.

This branch gives you a pre-compiled theme ready to use, and also all the tools you need to configure your own js and css files(gulp and codekit).


In any case, you can use it as is by cloning/downloading the .zip file.

* All bases functionalities from Genesis can be used. Just note that Primary menu will be the one in the top bar and make sure to make another one for the "drawer functionality".
* This child theme comes with a lot of ready to use common Genesis functions, check the `lib` folder.
* This is totally open source, so feel free to use/change as you wish.
* Licensed under GPLv2.

How to use
---------------

Nothing is more easy, download .zip or clone this repository, add it to your themes folder or upload it(only a .zip file) from your website adminstration panel and you are ready to go.

If you want to use it with gulp, this theme now uses the really well done [WPGULP](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp) so this gulp file may always stay updated. 
Just set up your project variables in the gulpfile, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then just run `gulp`.
A `gulp build` task is also prepacked giving you your optimized theme in a ready to upload .zip file

Prefer codekit, easy, just run `npm install` and you are good to go.

Included is a dummy-content.xml file if you ever need some content, it's actually taken from Genesis base child Theme.


You are now ready to go! 

Enjoy!
